## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts

Flexmonster Pivot is a powerful JavaScript tool for interactive web reporting. It allows you to visualize and analyze data from JSON, CSV, SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OLAP data sources quickly and conveniently. Flexmonster is designed to integrate seamlessly with any client-side framework and can be easily embedded into your application.

This repository contains the Flexmonster Pivot plugin for [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

## Requirements

The version of Kibana should be compatible with Elasticsearch. For more details, check the [support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_compatibility). 

For the latest versions, please make changes in `package.json` and/or other files if necessary.

The following is the most recent working configuration:
- Kibana v.7.3.2
- Plugin v.1.21
- react-flexmonster@2.7.24

## Step 1. Install the Flexmonster Pivot plugin

Navigate to the Kibana `bin/` folder and run the following commands in the console:

```bash
kibana-plugin install https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-kibana/releases/download/v1.21/flexmonster_pivot-v1.21.zip
cd plugins/flexmonster_pivot
yarn add flexmonster@2.7.24 --flat
yarn add react-flexmonster@2.7.24-1 --flat
```

## Step 2. Add the license key for Flexmonster

Specify the license key in [FlexmonsterPivotTable.js](https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-kibana/blob/master/public/components/flexmonster/FlexmonsterPivotTable.js#L42) as follows:

```javascript
<FlexmonsterReact.Pivot
  ref="pivot"
  toolbar={true}
  componentFolder="https://cdn.flexmonster.com/" 
  report={this.props.report}
  licenseKey="XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
/>
```

Note that `licenseKey` is your license or trial key, so replace `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` with an actual key. If you donâ€™t have a license key, [contact our team](https://www.flexmonster.com/contact/).


## Step 3. Enable CORS for Elasticsearch 

Open `elasticsearch.yml` and add the following configurations:

```
http.cors.enabled : true
http.cors.allow-origin : "*"
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
http.cors.allow-methods : OPTIONS,HEAD,GET,POST,PUT,DELETE
http.cors.allow-headers : kbn-version,Origin,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept,Engaged-Auth-Token,Content-Length,Authorization
```

## Step 4. Enable CORS for Kibana

Open `kibana.yml` and add the following configurations:

```
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
server.cors: true
server.cors.origin: ['*']
```

## Step 5. See the results

A new tab with Flexmonster Pivot will be available if you open Kibana:
